For those of us who are starting out in Cybersecurity, SANS has a great opportunity to fast-track
our career through the Cyber FastTrack Capture the Flag (CTF) competition. But before I explain 
what the CTF is, let me first explain what SANS is. SANS is an organization that provides
world-class Cybersecurity training and industry-recognized certificates. Cybersecurity is a
rapidly growing field with many unfilled jobs. SANS wants to prepare the next generation of
cyber warriors to fill those jobs by giving them access to the crucial training they need and the
ability to gain certifications that Cybersecurity hiring managers look for...all for FREE!

--------------------------------

What is the Cyber FastTrack CTF?
--------------------------------

The Cyber FastTrack CTF is a two-day competition where participants solve jeopardy style
challenges. The challenges range from easy to hard difficulty and cover topics such as networking,
forensics, cryptography, and reverse engineering. Those who do well in the CTF get an invitation
to apply to the scholarship that will cover the cost of the SANS Applied Cybersecurity Undergraduate
Certificate course. When I participated in the CTF last October, the scholarship was the ultimate
prize. Looking at the [Cyber FastTrack](https://cyber-fasttrack.org/) website now, they seem to
have added a lot of other cool prizes.

Who can participate?
--------------------

Anyone who is a current college student or a recent graduate can participate. And don't worry
if you think you don't have any skills! I participated in the competition having learned about the
Cybersecurity field just two months prior! I had no skills but I still wanted to try it out for
fun and to learn something new. Never in a million years did I think I would get the scholarship!

When is the CTF?
----------------

There are many different cohorts (Spring, Summer, and Winter) for the CTF in a year. I would check
the Cyber FastTrack website to see if the registration is currently open or sign up for their
newsletter to get the latest updates.

How to prepare for the CTF?
---------------------------

There are a lot of free resources out there that I wish I had utilized to better prepare myself
for the CTF (I made an [article](https://baishakicodes.github.io/Getting-Started/) on free resources, check it out!). 
I wasn't able to solve that many challenges because I was limited by my knowledge of the field 
and time (the competition takes place during a weekday). If I were to participate in this CTF again, 
I would have gone on sites like [Hoppers Roppers](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/) or [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/). 
If you are planning to participate in this CTF and want to prepare, I would recommend working through
the following resources:

1. Introduction to Computing Fundamentals course on Hoppers Roppers 
2. The following rooms on tryhackme:
    1. Linux Fundamentals
    2. c4ptur3-th3-fl4g
    3. Advent of Cyber 

When you register for the CTF, the organizers also send emails with resources to help you
prepare so I would also pay attention to those.

Scholarship Application Process
-------------------------------

After particpating in the CTF, it usually takes two weeks to get the invitation to apply for the
scholarship. Here are the important components of the scholarship application (some of these steps
may have changed):

1. Complete an exam
    *Used to test your knowledge on Cybersecurity concepts
    *Not counted towards your acceptance (thankfully)
2. Create a video presentation
    *Introduce yourself and mention things you're passionate about and excel at
    *A 2-3 minute video would suffice
    *Try to practice your answers beforehand; the application lists out the questions you should answer
     in the video
3. Answer short essay questions
    *These questions cover a variety of topics such as involvement in extracurricular activities, previous
     experience in Cybersecurity, time where you worked to improve a community, and qualities that make you
     unique (hobbies, hidden talents, life experiences)
    *My advice for these questions would be to be as authentic as possible and give details

Once you submit the form and complete the exam, it will take about a month to hear back on your
application status and details on next steps.

-----------------------------------------

I hope this was helpful and I was able to successfully convince you to participate in the Cyber 
FastTrack CTF. Whatever the outcome is, you'll have a great time and learn something in the 
process!
