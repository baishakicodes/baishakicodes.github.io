For those of us who are starting out in Cybersecurity, SANS has a great opportunity to fast-track
our career through the Cyber FastTrack Capture the Flag (CTF) competition. But before I explain 
what the CTF is, let me first explain what SANS is. SANS is an organization that provides
world-class Cybersecurity training and industry-recognized certificates. Cybersecurity is a
rapidly growing field with many unfilled jobs. SANS wants to prepare the next generation of
cyber warriors to fill those jobs by giving them access to the crucial training they need and the
ability to gain certifications that Cybersecurity hiring managers look for...all for FREE!

--------------------------------

What is the Cyber FastTrack CTF?
--------------------------------

The Cyber FastTrack CTF is a two-day competition where participants solve jeopardy style
challenges. The challenges range from easy to hard difficulty and cover topics such as networking,
forensics, cryptography, and reverse engineering. Those who do well in the CTF get an invitation
to apply to the scholarship that will cover the cost of the SANS Applied Cybersecurity Undergraduate
Certificate course. When I participated in the CTF last October, the scholarship was the ultimate
prize. Looking at the [Cyber FastTrack](https://cyber-fasttrack.org/) website now, they seem to
have added a lot of other cool prizes.

Who can participate?
--------------------

Anyone who is a current college student or a recent graduate can participate. And don't worry
if you think you don't have any skills! I participated in the competition having learned about the
Cybersecurity field just two months prior! I had no skills but I still wanted to try it out for
fun and to learn something new. Never in a million years did I think I would get the scholarship!

When is the CTF?
----------------

There are many different cohorts (Spring, Summer, and Winter) for the CTF in a year. I would check
the Cyber FastTrack website to see if the registration is currently open or sign up for their
newsletter to get the latest updates.

How to prepare for the CTF?
---------------------------

There are a lot of free resources out there that I wish I had utilized to better prepare myself
for the CTF (I made an article on free resources, check it out!). I wasn't able to solve that many
challenges because I was limited by my knowledge of the field and time (the competition takes place
during a weekday). If I were to participate in this CTF again, I would have gone on sites like
[Hoppers Roppers](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/) or [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/). If you are
planning to participate in this CTF and want to prepare, I would recommend the Introduction to
Computing Fundamentals course on Hoppers Roppers and the "Linux Fundamentals," "c4ptur3-th3-fl4g,"
and "Advent of Cyber" rooms on tryhackme. When you register for the CTF, the organizers also send
emails with resources to help you prepare so I would also pay attention to those.

Scholarship Application Process
-------------------------------

After particpating in the CTF, it usually takes two weeks to get the invitation to apply for the
scholarship. As part of the application process, I had to complete an exam with questions that
tested my knowledge on Cybersecurity concepts. The test was only to gauge my knowledge on
Cybersecurity and was not counted towards my acceptance (thankfully). In addition to the exam, I 
was required to create a video presentation, a form with short answer essays, and resume.

The content of the video presentation was simple: introduce yourself, things you're passionate 
about, and something you excel at. I'll admit my video wasn't the greatest (I was super nervous 
and had to clear my throat alot) but some tips I would give is to write down your answers to the
above questions and practice in front of a mirror before taking the final video. Also, don't make 
the video too long, less than five minutes is fine (mine was two minutes and thirty seconds).

The short answer essays ranged from questions such as my involvement in extracurricular activities,
my experience with Cybersecurity before I participated in the CTF, a time where I worked to 
improve my community, and the qualities that make me unique (hobbies, hidden talents, life 
experiences). My advice for these questions is to be as authentic as possible and give details!

Once you submit the form and complete the exam, it will take about a month to hear back on your
application status and details on next steps.

-----------------------------------------

I hope this was helpful and I was able to successfully convince you to participate in the Cyber 
FastTrack CTF. Whatever the outcome is, you'll have a great time and learn something in the 
process!
