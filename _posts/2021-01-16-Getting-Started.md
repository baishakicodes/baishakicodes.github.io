For beginners like me looking to get their foot into cybersecurity, a plethora of free resources exist online to help us. But where do we begin?! How do we know we're not just going in circles trying to learn things that aren't as relevant to us at this early stage of our cybersecurity journey? To solve this problem, I've listed some resources that I started out with to make sense of this complex field. Keep in mind that these are resources **I** started out with and found helpful. Others might recommend different resources.



Training & Skill-building
-------------------------

**1. [Hoppers Roppers](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/)**
	
Hoppers Roppers Academy is a website run by Dennis Devey. The website has various courses all free that are well structured and focus on various aspects of cybersecurity. I recommend starting off with the Introduction to Computing Fundamentals course. It includes topics such as building your own home lab, learning the basics of linux, operating systems, networking, and more. I'm enrolled in this course currently and as a beginner I really appreciate the structure and organization of the course.

**2. [tryhackme.com](https://tryhackme.com/)**

tryhackme.com is another great resource to help you start building some skills! All content on the website are organized in "rooms." So there's a room for learning pentesting, a room for learning OSINT, a room to learn a specific tool and so on. While there are many rooms you have to pay a subscription to gain access to, there are also many free rooms that have amazing content. I espcially love the free Capture the Flag (CTF) rooms because I'm not only learning something new but I'm learning it through solving challenges. I really appreciate the hands-on aspect of tryhackme.


Security News
-------------

**1. [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/)**

Krebs on Security is a security news site created by Brian Krebs, an investigative journalist. He posts articles related to the latest threats and events in cybersecurity. Krebs on Security is a great place to keep up with the latest happenings in the cyberworld because Krebs makes complex concepts and technologies easier to understand by breaking them down and providing simple explanations.

**2. [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/)**

The Hacker News is another security news site that publishes articles frequently. The articles are short and to the point. Although, for those of us just starting out, some terms and concepts might be hard to understand and it might be a little overwhelming to stay on top of each event. Nevertheless, this is a great source to stay knowledgeable about cybersecurity.


Conferences
-----------

I only have one recommendation on this section (I haven't attended many conferences): [The Diana Initiative](https://www.dianainitiative.org/). The Diana Initiative Conference is a conference focused on women, diversity, and inclusion in information security. This was my first ever conference and I'm glad it was because I met so many amazing women and learned a ton about the field. It was through this conference that I learned about different cybersecurity communities like WeAreHackerz, the Blue Team Village mentee program, and more. I attended on August of 2020 when it was virtual and free so I got lucky! :)


Places to Find More Resources
-----------------------------

**1. [r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/)**

Reddit is a great place to find information and it's no different for cybersecurity. This was the place I first went to when I realized I wanted to explore what cybersecurity was all about. This was where I learned about Hoppers Roppers Academy and The Diana Initiative. This subreddit has an ongoing list of free resources ranging from free courses to webinars to conferences and more. So definitely check this out!

**2. [DFIR Diva](https://dfirdiva.com/)**

DFIR Diva is an Incident Response Analyst who has a blog where she documents all the resources she uses to help her navigate the Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) subfield of cybersecurity. There are general cybersecurity/IT related resources as well as more DFIR centric resources. She also posts resources on twitter so definitely follow her in addition to checking out her site.



Glad you made it to the end! I've tried to keep the list short because I know when faced with too many options, it can get overwhelming pretty quick. Definitely check out these resources and get to exploring!
