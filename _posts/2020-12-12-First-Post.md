![Adventure](/images/adventure.jpg "Adventure")

This is my first time using github pages to create a blog. It will take some to get used to but I think it will be a worthwile journey!

I'm hoping to use this blog to document my cybersecurity journey and the things I learn throughout! 
Join me in this adventure!
