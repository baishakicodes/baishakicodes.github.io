Hello! My name is Baishaki Debi. I am currently a student studying computer science but what I'm really interested in is cybersecurity! The cybersecurity field has become quite popular just like Data Science but I didn't know if it was something I truly wanted to do. Frankly, it seemed really stressful. But my perspective about the field changed after watching scambaiters like Jim Browning and Kitboga. It was so cool to watch Jim Browning exploit a flaw in remote access software to gain reverse access to scammers' computers. With that access he was able to learn the inner workings of the scam and help victims recover their money. On the other hand, Kitboga would use his social engineering skills to waste hours and days of scammers' time. It was truly awesome to watch. I didn't know such amazing things could be done with cybersecurity! More importantly, I learned that cybersecurity could be used to make positive impact in the world. 

I created this blog to document my journey within cybersecurity. While there are alot of resources out there, it's hard to know where to begin. So, I'm hoping this blog can help others as well!
